## About me

Gaming sparked my interest in computing. To enter the Cybersecurity industry, I pursued a degree in computer science which opened me up to the world of open-source(bad pun intended). I enjoy learning not only about security incidents, vulnerabilities and hacks, but also issues related to the gaming industry.

#### Interests

Having benefitted from various open-source tools and projects, I'm invested in open-source and also game preservation. As such, I hope to be able to contribute to open-source emulation projects and/or cybersecurity tools someday.

### Languages

Most of my courses were done in Python, so that's the language I'm most familiar with. Other languages I had to pick up due to module requirements or projects are C/C++, Javascript/CSS/HTML and SQL.
